# Merging_and_rebasing_project_JEM234
This is the final project for [Version Control with Git](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/predmety/index.php?id=d4fc1a28757fa7cb0535480204a94045&tid=&do=predmet&kod=JEM234&skr=2024) created by Jan Sklenička and Sebastian Černý. The content of this project focuses on advanced merging strategies and rebasing in Git. These are essential techniques, particularly in collaborative development environments, where multiple contributors work on the same codebase.

Git provides various ways to manage changes and ensure smooth collaboration. However, as projects grow in complexity, managing multiple branches and avoiding conflicts becomes increasingly difficult. This project delves into the most effective strategies for handling merges and rebases to maintain a clean and efficient workflow.

## Content
The project consists from two main parts:
* [Advanced merging strategies](./Merging_approaches.md)
  * This section covers merging strategies, starting with basic concepts and progressing to more advanced techniques.
* [Rebasing](./Rebasing.md)
  * The second part talks about rebasing techniques and differences between rebasing and merging.
